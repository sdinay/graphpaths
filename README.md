# Prolog flight plan

Using W. Mackey's graphpaths code as the starter code, print a valid flight plan

Included some hints on how I approached this program. Hope it helps

## Test

fly(atl, lax)

## Database

The database at the top of the file contains only a small set of flights. The database provided by the course includes many more flights.

## Hint

In the program description, the program prints our cities in capital letters. You can add a database of airport codes to uppercase representations like this:

```
uppercase(atl, 'ATL')
```

for a way to print identically to the program description.
